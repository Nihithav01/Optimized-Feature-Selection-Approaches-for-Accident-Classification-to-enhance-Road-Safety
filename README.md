# Optimized-Feature-Selection-Approaches-for-Accident-Classification-to-enhance-Road-Safety

### In the modern era, the issue of road accidents has become an increasingly critical global
### concern, requiring urgent attention and innovative solutions. This investigation has compiled
### an extensive dataset of 10,356 accident occurrences that occurred between the years 2018
### and 2022 in Ernakulam district. By utilizing advanced feature selection methodologies, such
### as Genetic Algorithm and Coyote Optimization, this research has identified pivotal accident
### determinants. The study harnesses the potential of deep learning techniques, encompassing
### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory
### (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), for accident severity classification (categorized
### as fatal, grievous, and severe). Eight predictive models are trained using the dataset, and the
### top two are ensembled. Integrating deep learning and optimization strategies, this research
### aims to create a robust accident classification system. The system will help in developing
### proactive policies that can reduce the frequency and severity of accidents in Ernakulam
### district.
